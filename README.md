# 🐺 Getaway

**Getaway** is a retro-style, fast-paced **3D trap-dodging action game** built using classic **raycasting** techniques — inspired by *Wolfenstein 3D*. Navigate dangerous corridors, dodge deadly traps, and race to the end of each level with nothing but your reflexes and your dash.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- 🔲 First-person view in a raycasted 3D world
- 🌀 No shooting — it's all about movement, timing, and survival
- ⚠️ Avoid spikes, crushers, fire traps, lasers, and more
- 🚪 Reach the exit without dying — easier said than done
- 🕹️ Speedrun-friendly level design


## 📦 Features

- Retro-style graphics inspired by 90s shooters
