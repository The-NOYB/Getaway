## 🌟 Current Contributions (Phase 1)
For this phase, our goal is to establish the core experience of CrossMind using pre-made courses and filtering options instead of the full AI-driven course creation. Here’s what we need:

- **Homepage & Courses Page Implementation:**  
  - Create a responsive homepage that introduces CrossMind.  
  - Build a dedicated page to display a list of pre-made courses with details (course title, description, domains covered, etc.).

- **Course Filtering Options:**  
  - Develop UI elements (e.g., dropdown menus, checkboxes) that allow users to filter courses by domain (such as Chemistry, Communications, History, Biology, etc.).

- **Domain Pool Setup:**  
  - Create a data structure (e.g., JSON file) that holds the list of available domains and associated metadata.  
  - Integrate this domain pool with the filtering functionality.

- **Static Course Data:**  
  - Populate the courses page with sample courses that showcase different domain combinations.  
  - Ensure each course includes details to illustrate how multiple domains are merged (e.g., Chemistry + Communications, History + Biology).

- **Documentation & Guidelines Update:**  
  - Update the README and this CONTRIBUTING guide with the current project scope, explaining that Phase 1 is focused on pre-made courses and filtering rather than AI-driven generation.
